# ♾️ Solving Supply Chain & Operations with AI

## About Me

I am an experienced Supply Chain & Operations leader with over 20 years of international management expertise in manufacturing, retail, and logistics.  
Today, I leverage **Artificial Intelligence** to transform supply chain performance, reduce costs, and enable data-driven decision-making for SMEs and enterprises.  

My focus is on **AI strategy**, **AI agent development**, and **process automation**, combining technical know-how with strong business acumen.
