# ♾️ Solving Supply Chain & Operations with AI

## About Me

I am an experienced **Supply Chain & Operations** leader with over 20 years of international management expertise in **Manufacturing**, **Retail**, and **Logistics**.
Today, I leverage **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to transform **Supply Chain Performance**, reduce costs, and enable **Data-Driven Decision-Making** for SMEs.

My focus is on **AI Strategy**, **AI Agent Development**, and **Process Automation**, combining technical know-how with strong business acumen.
